I've been testing and collecting Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas mod packs that have been released for use with the PlayStation 3. This main page will be updated as I acquire and upload more mod packs and test them, currently we have the "Elite Edition" mod pack by Elite Electronics for Fallout 3 GOTY/Ultimate Edition and an "Cheat Terminal" mod pack for Fallout New Vegas Ultimate Edition, you can locate these on the releases page for download. Please refer to the readme.txt files included in each release for detailed information about these mod packs, mod authors, credits, features, mod lists, installation instructions and other details.

- Fallout New Vegas Cheat Terminal Mod Pack for PlayStation 3 (for Fallout New Vegas Ultimate Edition)

This modpack for Fallout New Vegas Ultimate Edition provides the player with a cheat terminal in Doc's office at the beginning of the game that's right next to the vigor testing machine (to spend/configure SPECIAL skills). It also includes a "portable terminal" that allows the player to access the cheat terminal anywhere in the game. More information is located in the readme.txt included with the release.
